<p class="Lemme>"> 
Helping Hands is a non-profit organization dedicated to serving those most at-risk to COVID-19: <br><br>
senior citizens, the immune compromised, and people with pre-existing medical conditions which <br><br> 
put them at additional risk. <br><br>
Our community volunteers and delivery partners deliver groceries, medicine, and other necessary <br>
<br>
supplies to empower everyone to stay healthy and be as responsible as they can be.

<p>Helping Hands Community connects those who must shelter in place with our 
    volunteers and delivery partners so groceries, medication and essential  
    supplies get delivered 
    safely. Our technology platform makes community
    volunteerism easy and reliable while providing 
    an intuitive solution for
     partners to scale their own impact. 
 <br><br>
Our partner solutions allow organizations to fulfill custom and batch requests  
at scale through the
 Helping Hands Community platform, while we connect 
 individuals who need help and can offer help 
 through our website. <br>
