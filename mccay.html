      <h2>Travelling in Depression</h2>
      <p>
       When I was very little, I caught the Traveling bug. It started 
        after my grandparents first brought me to their home in<br/> France and
         I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me 
         a unique learning experience.
      </p>
         
         <P> At five, I marveled at the Eiffel 
         Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Pizza
        San Marco<br/>feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian
        waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient,<br/>
        megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the Great Wall of 
        China, amezed that the thousand-year-old<br>stones were still in place.
        <br><br>
      It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first become 
       interested in language. <br>
         
     <img id="girl" src="girl.jpeg" alt="girl">
             <p> It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation. <br> I 
remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was. <br> 
But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more <br>
 accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered. <br><br>

 In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its <br> 
similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is <br> 
béisbol, which looks different but sounds 
 nearly the same. This was incredible <br> to me as it made speech and comprehension 
 more fluid, and even today I find <br> that cognates come to the rescue when I forget 
 how to say something <br> in Spanish.
 
<p> Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm 
 for Chinese. As I studied <br> Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke 
 was missing from a <br> character, the meaning is lost. I loved how long words were 
 formed by <br> combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) 
 meaning <br> mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano. I 
 love <br> spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty 
 and rhythm as I form them.
