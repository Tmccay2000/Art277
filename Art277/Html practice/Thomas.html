    <h1> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
        <!--my paragraph begins here-->
        <p><b> Lorem Ispsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and type setting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the<br> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s. When an unknown printer took a gallery of type and <br> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the released of <br> Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br> <b><i><u>Aldus PageMaker</u></i></b> including version of <b><i><u>Lorem Ipsum.</u></i></b> 1914 translation by <b>H.Rackham</b><br></p>
            
       <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sitamet, consectetur adispiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore <br> et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris misi<br> ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluplate velit esse<br> cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occarcat non proident, sunt in culpa<br> qui officia deserunt mollst anim id est labourum.</p>

<h1> Why do we use it?</h1>
     
        <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readeable content of a page when looking at it's <br> layout. The point of using <b><u>Lorem Ipsum</u></b> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to <br> using Content here,content here", making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and<br> web page editor now use <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> as their default model text, and a search for "lorem ipsum" will uncover<br> many web site still in their infancy . Various version have evolved over the years ,sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
        
        <h1> Where can i get some?</h1>
        <p><b> There are many variation of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered<br> alteration in some form, by injected humour, or by <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly <br> believable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need t be sure there isn't anything<br> embarrasing hidden in the middle of the test. <i> All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend o repeat<br> predefined chunks as neccessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</i> It uses a dictionary of over<br> 200 latin words, combined ith a handful of model sentence structures, to generate lorem Ipsum which looks<br> reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always from repetition, injected humour, or non-<br>characteristic words etc. </p>
